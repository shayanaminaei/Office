# 🏢 Office Project by Shayan Aminaei

This project is a simple **Employee and Client Management System** implemented in **Java**, following **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as **Inheritance** and **Encapsulation**.  
It is designed according to a UML diagram and models a business office scenario with different types of employees and clients.

---

## 📌 Features
- Implements **inheritance** to define various employee and client subclasses.  
- Supports adding **multiple employees or clients** interactively via console input.  
- Each class handles its own data input (`save()` method) and information display (`showInfo()` method).  
- Structured code based on the provided **UML diagram** to demonstrate class hierarchies and relationships.

---

## 📜 Classes Overview
The system includes:

1. **Retail Client**  
2. **Wholesale Client**  
3. **Office Employee**  
4. **Finance Employee**  
5. **Finance and Cashier Employee**

*(Other classes like Sales or Warehouse employees can be added similarly.)*

## 📚 Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **Inheritance** for class hierarchies  
- **Encapsulation** of class fields and methods  
- Using **Scanner** for console input  
- Looping structures to allow multiple entries
